{"prompt":"I wish that I could find a man that knows exactly what anxiety feels like.. I feel like most ppl don't actually know what anxiety is or feels like physically. I want someone I can feel comfortable and safe with while I'm having an anxiety attack too. I live alone in my own room but with roommates who have their own room also. We don't talk hardly ever because of the language barrier. They speak Spanish and some English and I speak English but only understand Spanish..... Idk how to speak Spanish.. They're Columbian too if that matters. I'm an American born citizen... I wish I lived with ppl I could get along with. Ppl I could actually confide in and trust. My family lives states away and I live here, it's difficult. This is actually helping my anxiety right now too. Thankfully. I want to cuddle... I don't have anyone to cuddle... I've been to the doctor and gotten a few EKGs and even called the ambulance once because my left arm started bothering me but when they got here, I started to calm down. The one guy talked to me for about an hour while the last was writing papers and had me sign a few things. A few minutes after they left, a sherif called to make sure they responded. I live in NYC and that's nice that they call to make sure they respond. That even happened when I called for the fire dept because the pettiness were throwing electricity and sparks right outside my apartment building. It messed up the electricity for a few days.
