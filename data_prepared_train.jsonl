{"prompt":"Hi reddit,I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but I am abit confused.basically people at my school think I'm weird (well used to think that,but seem like they are started to know me abit more now)however there is one particular group of boys in my year who are freinds with people from other schools.some of these boys (,at my school) are starting to speak to me more nicely and be are being more nice.But the other week I shouted some random boy out on my snap story (who everyone calls a 'nonce) and this group of boys also dislike him and all their freinds from the other school viewed my story.Another thing that happened on my snap story is tellonyms where people were making rumours about me dating a boy in their freindship group.Again the same bunch of lads from the other school were viewing my story again.Yet I have never met them in my life and aren't freinds with them on snap.Does this mean bad rumours are going around about me?Am I right to think it's abit strange?-->","completion":" 0"}
